## First Catastophe
I had a new window installed in my `office`, you know the enery efficient kind.  Well, I had to temporarly shut down my ESXi host and move it while the contractor installed it, and after restart, it well doesn't restart!

Good news. RJ45 not installed with the `click` which was a quick fix
